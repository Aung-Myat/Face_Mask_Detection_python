# Face_Mask_Detection_python

The process of this repo is to check if a person is wearing a mask or not.

In this repo, we build a deep learning network model (CNN = Convolutional Neural Network) by uisng one of a deep learning framework called Tensorflow(tf) for image classification process.

Image classification is one type of computer vision. 

And it is very simple in training compared with the others.

For beginners, this repo is built to easily understand how CNN layers are used and how the input images are preprocessed before transfered into deep learning model.
